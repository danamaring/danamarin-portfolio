            <h1>THE <br>ORGANIZATION</h1>
            <p>
                The Regional HIV/AIDS Connection (RHAC) is a government organization designated to help diminish the spread of HIV in Ontario, Canada. <br><br> 
                Their altruistic work ranges from organizing seminars for students to teaching homeless how to get high properly without getting infected in the process. One of the jobs of the organization is to fight stigma and discrimination against people with HIV/AIDS. <br><br>
                I had the opportunity to listen to some stories of real people with HIV that suffer more from the stigma and discrimination than for the actual virus, so I was more than happy to create a campaign that would help fight this situation.            </p>

            <h1>THE TARGET</h1>
            <p>
                So we already know the cause and the goal, but what deliverables should we choose for the campaign? That was one of the main questions that we asked ourselves during the creation of the project.<br><br> 
                To answer the question we had to pay close attention to our target: teenagers from 13 to 18 years old. What do they do? Where do they spend most of their time? How should we address them? How can we get their attention in a fast-paced environment? What tone should we use? The research began.<br><br> 
                We downloaded the apps they use, followed the influencers they admire, listened to the music they like, visited the places they frequent and finally came up with great ideas.

            <h1 class="hidden">Mixtape Project - The solution</h1>
            <h1>THE CAMPAIGN: PHASE 1</h1>
            <p>
                Our campaign is based on empathy. We want teenagers to look at the problem as if it were them the ones with the illness. <br><br>
                We want to connect emotionally, but most importantly, we want them to know that they can be part of the cure. To reach the goal, we divided the campaign into three different phases. <br><br>
                Phase 1: awareness. We designed printed posters, social media ads (covering Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok), story filters and an amazing website to get their attention. We want teenagers to realize there is a problem that affects lots of people and it is on their hands to stop that. 
            </p>

        <!-- phase 2 -->
        <section id="solution" class="campaign-title">
            <h1 class="hidden">Mixtape Project - The solution</h1>
            <h1>THE CAMPAIGN: PHASE 2</h1>
            <p>
                At this point, most of the teenagers would have seen our posters, ads and videos. They will be able to recognize our logo, colours and message, but they won’t really know a lot about HIV/AIDS, or how serious the problem is. That’s when the second phase comes in.<br><br> 
                Phase 2 is the educational phase, now we release the informational video that addresses teenagers and demonstrates all the daily activities that they can perform with an HIV positive person without getting infected. The idea is that if we’re fighting stigma and discrimination, we have to be clear, even if that sounds obvious for some people.<br><br> 
                We also invite the community to take a look at our website in which we have more reliable information, videos, a contact page and a stories section in which they can read about real people with real HIV sharing their thoughts on how stigma and discrimination affect their life.

        <!-- phase 3 -->
        <section id="solution" class="campaign-title">
            <h1 class="hidden">Mixtape Project - The solution</h1>
            <h1>THE CAMPAIGN: PHASE 3</h1>
            <p>
                Last but not least, phase 3: action. One of the main points of this phase is the in-school seminars. We want easy-going people to talk about HIV/AIDS, educate students on the real ways that they could get infected and how to prevent that. We want to share real stories of how people have to cope every day with discrimination.<br><br> 
                At the end of the seminar, we will bring in a branded vehicle with banners and lots of SWAG, because who doesn’t love SWAG? We will organize some activities that involve lots of pictures and social media platforms. The goal of this event is to share some thoughts on the topic, spread the word and make some noise on social media.

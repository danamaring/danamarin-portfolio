            <p>
                This project is the result of an 8-weeks long course I took with Northern to learn how Shopify works and the different languages that the platform uses to build B2C websites. <br><br>
                The first step was to select a niche market and create a unique business name, logo and overall branding. After a few weeks, I learnt how to download the different themes that Shopify works with and more importantly, how to edit them to develop a fully customizable online shop.

            <h1>THE GOALS</h1>
            <p>
                Some of the goals of the project were to create a landing page, making sure to tweak the theme accordingly to the niche market and target audiences. <br><br>
                What are some of the things that users look for when they open the website? Are users looking for a specific product or they are just searching around? How long will they stay on the landing page? How can I take advantage of that time to engage the user? These are some of the questions that I asked myself before I built the landing page. <br><br>
                I did my research and the result is a landing page with an attractive full-width hero image with a button to take the user to the next page. Since most of the users only spend a few seconds on the landing page, it is important to provide buttons and links to different pages. <br><br>
                It has been proven that the more time the user spends on the website, the more likely it is to buy a product, so the goal of the landing page is to give them strategic links to other pages to keep them moving on to the next steps.

                The online shop has more than 20 products that are organized in different collections. It has different features such as a bot messaging system that is there to help users through the sale process. It also has a rewards program, which is very popular among retail stores. <br><br> 
                The program offers points when the user signs up for the newsletter and buys merchandise. There is a quick access button for the users that displays the different ways of getting points and how to redeem them. Another great feature of the site is the review option for each product. Since the online shop sells different types of items that range from 50 to 11,000 dollars, it is important and realistic to have an option for users to leave their opinions and rates. <br><br> 
                Finally, all the checkout options are enabled. The platform offers several payment options and a very easy-to-follow checkout process. I customized it so that it is brand consistent and as easy to go through as possible.
